# Football Analytics   

This is my notebook project for learning football analytics. Used **StatsBomb** and **Wyscout** datasets and focused on the **Germany vs Spain (Women’s World Cup)** match. My goal was to explore the structure of football data, analyze match events, and create simple visualizations to understand how the teams played.

##  What I Did  

### 1. Data Exploration  
- Loaded **competition, match, lineup, and event data** from both StatsBomb and Wyscout.  
- Learned how the data is organized:
  - Competitions → Seasons → Matches → Players → Events.  
- Filtered the dataset to focus on the Germany vs Spain match.  

### 2. Lineups and Events  
- Looked at **lineup data** to see which players featured for both teams.  
- Analyzed **event data** like passes and shots to understand match flow.  

### 3. Visualizations  
- **Shot Maps**  
  - Plotted shots for Germany (red) and Spain (blue).  
  - Goals were shown as solid circles with the player’s name.  
  -  

- **Pass Networks (Work in Progress)**  
  - Started building pass network visualizations to see how players connected with each other.  
  -  
### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Counted number of players by country and team.  
- Looked at passing patterns and shot build-up.  
- Explored player positioning from event data.
